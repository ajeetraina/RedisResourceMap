# RedisResourceMap

Submission for Build on Redis Hackathon 2021 by Pranav Kumar and Josh Durham.

COVID-19 has ravaged healthcare systems globally, a problem that is only compounded in countries without an existing robust network. Recently we have seen India fall prey to supply chain failures, oxygen shortage, and a significant increase in cases/death, the latest in a series of countries struggling to deal with the pandemic.

Our app, backed by Redis modules such as RediSearch and [INSERT ANOTHER MODULE HERE IF WE USE IT?], is designed to provide a consolidated center of information to help connect areas with excess resources or supplies with those that are deficient.

We utilize the power of RediSearch's geospatial filtering to quickly query locations and [SOME OTHER REDIS FEATURE?]. This allows our app to operate at scale and under high demand, with constant updates and queries.
